## Interest ownership
- Device does not track `MY_INTERESTS` anymore.
- Interest profile should live on server and be keyed by device id.
- Optional testing path exists via `GET /v1/interests/{device_id}` in `server_match_client.py`.

## Matching behavior
- SEARCH and badge match behavior are driven by server `decision=true` only.
- Known non-matches are not actively re-queried while they remain nearby.
- No local fallback match path is used if server is unavailable.
- Client sends only `device_id_a` and `device_id_b` on `/v1/match`.
- Topic parsing uses a single server `topic` string and supports delimiters `|`, `,`, `;`.
- If multiple topics are present in one string, only the first valid topic is used.
- Topic priority is: server topic, then peer-broadcast topic, then `Conversation`.
- CHAT topics are locked at entry (no live topic swapping mid-chat).
- Icon/image resolution is server-first:
  - Try `icon_filename` from server response first.
  - If missing/invalid, fallback to local topic-to-image mapping.
- Topic panel rendering follows the demo style:
  - image on left + wrapped topic text on right.
- If no image is available, fallback uses large text style (same visual class as `Conversation` fallback), not small inline topic text.
